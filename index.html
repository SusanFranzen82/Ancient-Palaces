        <h1>Palaces of the Ancient World</h1>
        <hr />
        <p> The royal palace institute has traditionally been central to the societies of the ancient Near East. It was the center of power. The king was the fulcrum of the empire, the axis around which the whole system was organized.  <br /> 
    The king and his court always played a normative role in the society they ruled over, as a model for the aristocracy and for the (urban) upper class. The rich and powerful turned to the palace for information on how to behave, what to value and what to hold in high esteem. <br/> 
    At the same time, the palace is now a source for us to study conceptions of kingship, and the role of king and monarchy.
