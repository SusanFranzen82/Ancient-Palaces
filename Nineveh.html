        <h2>Excavations</h2>
        <p>Botta was the first to excavate on Kuyunjik in 1842, until he exchanged the site for Khorsabad. <br>
        Layard began excavating there in the summer of 1846, after the successful excavations at Nimrud. He moved out in June 1847, after which the excavations were taken over by H.J. Ross. Ross left in July 1848, and in September 1849 Layard returned. Until 1851 he excavated the Southwest Palace of Sennacherib, making many of the drawings of the reliefs himself.<br>
        When he left, he had unearthed 71 chambers and some 3 kilometers of reliefs. As in Nimrud, Rassam took over under the general leadership of Rawlinson until 1853. In 1853, just as british museum funds were running out, Rassam discovered the North Palace of Assurbanipal. After Rassam's departure, Loftus took over for just over a year.<br>
        When the great excavations ceased after 1855, the British Museum ordered the reburial of plates that were not removed, although many of them were later excavated and sold by traders. <br>
        From 1872, the British Museum periodically sent expeditions to Iraq, and occasionally finds were made, but no more large palaces. In the years 1873 and 1874, George Smith excavated more parts of the Southwest Palace, and between 1878 and 1882 Rassam again led the excavations. This was followed by E.A.W. Budge (1889-1890), L.W. King (1903-1904) and R.C. Thompson (1904-1905 and 1931-1932). <br>
        The most recent excavations took place between 1965 and 1967, led by Tariq Madhloom on behalf of the Iraqi Department of Antiquities. Parts of the palaces were excavated, allowing visitors to see the plates in place. However, many of these were damaged in the 90s of the last century.

        <h2>Palaces</h2>

        <ul>
            <h3><li>Sanherib's South Palace</li></h3>

            <p>Sennacherib built his 'Unparalleled Palace' in the southwest corner of Kuyunjik, at least partly on the site of the old Southwest Palace, which had already been completely destroyed. Prisoners of war provided the manpower, and the palace was built between c. 703-692 BC. 
            </p>
            <h4>Layout</h4>
            <p>At the moment, 71 rooms have been excavated, although this is less than half of the building. The palace of Sennacherib is made up of a number of courts (H, 6, 19, 64) with a reception suite around each court. Most of these reception suites consist of a reception room (e.g. 1), a room to retreat to (e.g. 5) and a bathroom (e.g. 4, visible at the alcove). These types of suites are seen as residential areas. Groups 24-27 and 29-41 deviate from this; They consist of more than 3 rooms and it is possible that these rooms had a more ceremonial function.

            <h3><li>Assurbanipal's North Palace</li></h3>
            <p>This palace was a triumph project after the victories over Babylon in 648 and Elam in 647. The stones were brought on Elamite chariots, and captured Arab kings were forced to do at least some of the work. The campaigns depicted in this building take place no later than 643 BC, so the palace will probably be completed in that year. According to Ashurbanipal, the old North Palace was a palace that Sennacherib had built and inhabited as crown prince and as king, and where Esarhaddon had grown up. However, this building had become dilapidated and Assurbanipal decided to build his palace there.

            </p>
            <h4>Layout</h4>
            <p>The palace was not far below the surface of the hill, and much of the palace has been destroyed by fire, erosion and later habitation. Less than half of the building has been excavated. The spaces that have been excavated are for official affairs, for state affairs. These are rooms A-W (not room U), of which rooms O and J are courts, around which the other rooms are grouped.
